Human Centered Design Exam Project

## Main Development files
The core implementation of the app is built around the following files:
- app/(tabs)/index.tsx
- components/ui/ModalSheet.tsx
- components/ui/TaskSheet.tsx
- components/ui/ItemDexModal.tsx
- components/ui/LeaderBoardModal.tsx
- components/flags.ts
- components/i18n.ts
- components/tts.ts

These constitute the primary codebase we actively developed and maintained.
All other files in the project are automatically generated by Expo or created as part of the framework’s internal structure.

## Running the Expo application

1. Navigate into `computervision-new/`.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` if you have not already.
3. Start the development server in offline mode with `npx expo start --offline`.

   *Running without `CI=1` allows the CLI to render the ASCII QR code that Expo Go
   expects. The QR code will only be reachable from devices that can connect to the
   container's network interface (e.g., when tunneling or port-forwarding the
   development server).*

When Metro reports that it is waiting on `http://localhost:8081`, the Expo server is up
and ready to connect from a simulator, emulator, or Expo Go.
