## Running the Expo application

1. Navigate into `computervision-new/`.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` if you have not already.
3. Start the development server in offline mode with `npx expo start --offline`.

   *Running without `CI=1` allows the CLI to render the ASCII QR code that Expo Go
   expects. The QR code will only be reachable from devices that can connect to the
   container's network interface (e.g., when tunneling or port-forwarding the
   development server).*

When Metro reports that it is waiting on `http://localhost:8081`, the Expo server is up
and ready to connect from a simulator, emulator, or Expo Go.
